Kicad Shapes/Footprints for Honeyone PB86 PB86-A1-R1 LED pressbutton

PB86 buttons are momentary switches with nice haptic click and built in LEDs.
They are similar to the buttons on the classic TR-808 drum machine.

I tweaked ScharreSoft's footprint to match the Honyone pinout of my buttons.
hopefully this is a good strting point for you.
